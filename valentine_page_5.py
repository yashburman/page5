This day was so intense and passionate!!! We did everything we wanted , touching, talking, cuddling, tying, and getting tied :smirk:.

We danced to your favorite songs, and you wore my T-shirt. You fit perfectly into my arms, like we were meant to be together. When I move my hand to the side of your face and kiss you, it just feels so right. Everything we do!
They we we touch, the way we kiss, they way we move, everything!!! And i can't keep my hands off you...i wanna give you all the massages in the world and i will take up every oppurtunity to grab and spank that very delicious booty of yours :triumph:

The point is your lips are all I want to taste, and your eyes are all I want to look at forever.

Love,

Your lover

Yes yes onek cringe I know, move on :triumph:
